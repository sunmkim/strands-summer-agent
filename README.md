# Summer Chatbot with Strands Agents

**Goal:**

To create a production-ready chatbot that gives information about inclement summer weather and climate/atmospheric conditions, and gives tips on how to exercise caution when you are outside during the day.

You can consider this a production-grade update using Strands to the previous [Summer Chatbot](https://github.com/sunmkim/summer-days) project that was built with LangGraph, which was more akin to a proof-of-concept.

## Technologies Used

- [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) (an open source agents SDK from AWS)
- [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/)
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
